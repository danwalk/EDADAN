# EDA - THE HOUSE ALWAYS WINS...most of the time

Data Science Student EDA Project

This project is to review popular betting patterns and discover the basic errors made by most people when it comes to sports betting.

The EDA is based on collecting scores and betting results from 3 different sports from the past 6 years, cleaning the data, uploading to mysql, visualising the data using workspaces, dashboards and stories in tableau and finally in streamlit/flask making the cleaned data available via API.
